options(scipen = 999)
library(tidyverse)

library(tidymodels)

data("ad_data")
alz <- ad_data
print("Hello R/Medicine 2020!")
```

# Your Turn 1

plot it

```{r}
ggplot(alz, aes(x = tau, 
                y = VEGF,
                colour = Class)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) 
```

# Your Turn 2

Run the chunk below and look at the output. Then, edit the code below to create a K-nearest neighbor classification model that uses the `kknn` engine. Save it as `nn_mod` and look at the object. What is different about the output?

```{r}
lr_mod <- 
  logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine(engine = "glm") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")
lr_mod
```

```{r}
nn_mod <- 
  nearest_neighbor() %>% 
  set_engine(engine = "kknn") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")
nn_mod
```


# Your Turn 3

Fill in the blanks. 

Use `initial_split()`, `training()`, and `testing()` to:

1. Split **alz** into training and test sets. Save the rsplit!

2. Extract the training data. Fit a linear model to it. 

3. Predict the testing data, and save the true values too.

4. Measure the accuracy of your model with your test set.  

Keep `set.seed(100)` at the start of your code.

*Hint: Be sure to remove every `_` before running the code!*

```{r}
set.seed(100) # Important!

alz_split  <- ________
alz_train  <- ________
alz_test   <- ________

nn_mod %>% 
  fit(Class ~ tau*VEGF, 
      data = ________) %>% 
  predict(new_data = ________) %>% 
  mutate(true_class = ________) %>% 
  accuracy(truth = ________, estimate = .pred_class)
```

```{r}
set.seed(100) # Important!

alz_split  <- initial_split(alz, prop = .9)
alz_train  <- training(alz_split)
alz_test   <- testing(alz_split)

nn_mod %>% 
  fit(Class ~ tau*VEGF, 
      data = alz_train) %>% 
  predict(new_data = alz_test) %>% 
  mutate(true_class = alz_test$Class) %>% 
  accuracy(truth = true_class, estimate = .pred_class)
```

## Your Turn 4

What would happen if you repeated this process? Would you get the same answers?

Note your accuracy from above. Then change your seed number and rerun just the last code chunk above. Do you get the same answer? 

Try it a few times with a few different seeds.

## Your Turn 5

Run the code below. What does it return?

```{r}
set.seed(100)
alz_folds <- 
    vfold_cv(alz_train, v = 10, strata = Class, breaks = 4)
alz_folds
```


## Your Turn 6

Modify the code below to use `fit_resamples` and `alz_folds` to cross-validate the regression tree model. What is the ROC AUC that you collect at the end?

```{r}
set.seed(100)
nn_mod %>% 
  fit(Class ~ tau*VEGF, 
      data = alz_train) %>% 
  predict(new_data = alz_test) %>% 
  mutate(true_class = alz_test$Class) %>% 
  accuracy(truth = true_class, estimate = .pred_class)
```

Answer:
```{r}
set.seed(100)
nn_mod %>% 
  fit_resamples(Class ~ tau*VEGF, 
                resamples = alz_folds) %>% 
  collect_metrics()
```
