```{r setup, include=FALSE}

ames <- make_ames() %>% 
  dplyr::select(-matches("Qu"))
```

# Your Turn 1

Write a pipe that creates a learner that uses `lm()` to fit a linear regression. Save it as `lm_spec` and look at the object. What does it return?

```{r}

```

# Your Turn 2

Double check. Does

```{r}
lm_fit <- lm_spec %>% fit(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data = ames)
lm_fit
```

give the same results as

```{r}
lm(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data = ames)
```


# Your Turn 3

Fill in the blanks. Use `predict()` to

1. Use your linear model to predict sale prices; save the tibble as `price_pred`  
1. Add a pipe and use `mutate()` to add a column with the observed sale prices; name it `truth`

```{r}
lm_fit <- 
  lm_spec %>% 
  fit(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data = ames)

price_pred <- 
  ________ %>% 
  predict(new_data = ________) %>% 
  ________

price_pred
```


# Your Turn 4

In your teams, decide which model:

1. Has the smallest residuals  
2. Will have lower prediction error. Why?  


# Your Turn 5

Fill in the blanks. 

Use `initial_split()`, `training()`, `testing()`, `lm()` and `rmse()` to:

1. Split **ames** into training and test sets. Save the rsplit!

2. Extract the training data. Fit a linear model to it. Save the model!

3. Measure the RMSE of your linear model with your test set.  

Keep `set.seed(100)` at the start of your code.

*Hint: Be sure to remove every `_` before running the code!*

```{r}
set.seed(100) # Important!

ames_split  <- ________
ames_train  <- ________
ames_test   <- ________

lm_fit <- 
  lm_spec %>% 
  fit(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, 
      data = ________)

price_pred  <- 
  ________ %>% 
  predict(new_data = ________) %>% 
  mutate(price_truth = ________)

________ %>% 
  rmse(truth = ________, estimate = ________)
```


# Your Turn 6

Write a pipe to create a model that uses the rpart package to fit a regression tree. Use `fit_split()` and `collect_metrics()` to compare the RMSE here to one using the linear model for the same formula- which is better?

*Hint: you'll need https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/articles/articles/Models.html*

```{r}
rt_spec <- 
  __________ %>%          
  __________ %>% 
  __________

set.seed(100) # Important!
rt_fit <- 
  __________ %>% 
  fit(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, 
      data = ames_train)

price_pred  <- 
  __________ %>% 
  predict(new_data = ames_test) %>% 
  mutate(price_truth = ames_test$Sale_Price)

price_pred %>% 
  rmse(truth = price_truth, estimate = .pred)
```
